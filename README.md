# Workspace-Management
Project which seeks to set up my workspace upon a restart. Opens previous open tabs in their respective windows, opens specific apps as necessary. 

This was effectively the result of an hour or two of "I wonder if I can do this in powershell?"

I might scrap this in favor of a more defined powershell project down the road.
